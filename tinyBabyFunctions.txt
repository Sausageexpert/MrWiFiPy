Anything

This is a friendship therapy session for Mr. Py, since he apparently scares all his friends away
whenever he smiles (no idea why)

Anyway, maybe the problem is that his teeth are too shiny. If he kept them in his mouth more often,
maybe the squirrel wouldn't think the smile was for his funeral. That might help

Also, it might help to styrofoam wrap all his scales so baby functions can play with him for
consolation (and they can even vote for him when they grow up)
